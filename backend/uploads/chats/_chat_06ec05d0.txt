Acabo de hablar con el vecino de abajo. Parece ser que le está cayendo agua en el baño del máster. 

A él le gustaría que pasaran para ver si es que durante la demolición algo ocurrió para que esto pasara. 

El vecino se llama Gustavo. Si quieren cuando Uds lleguen a la obra me llaman para coordinar. 

Gracias

[7/8/24, 5:45:21 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Thank you Eddie! 

1. Tiles: today we bought all floor tiles and the tiles for the guest bathroom and our son’s bathroom. We still need to buy the master bathrooms tiles. 
 2 - today we bought the toilets for all 3 bathrooms. We still haven’t bought the tub for the kid’s bathroom. 
3- Washer and dryer have been bought. Washer arrives August 1st. Dryer arrives a bit after that. We can send you model and dimensions later tonight.  

The tiles were bought at Marble Shop / Tile Shop. Since we didn’t know whether you had personnel to pick up tiles and carry them up the elevators we arranged to pay extra fee for delivery to get them inside the apt. 

Let us know what day next week you prefer so we can make the arrangements. Or if you’d rather do the arrangements directly I can communicate. 

Gracias.

Anne, you can have the tiles delivered for Tuesday, July 23rd

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.

We’re starting the construction today.

Also, we’re going to need an additional master key.  Is it possible?

We found only two faucets at the Apt. do you have the others?

Thank you.

Thanks
[7/15/24, 8:43:56 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Hi Eddie- that’s all great news! Thank you. I have the boxes with the other faucets down here. I’ll swing by 18N soon with them. We’ll look into the extra key ask and get back to you soon as well.
[7/15/24, 8:44:25 AM] Eddie Valdés: Perfect

Thanks Roberto
[7/15/24, 8:53:51 AM] Luis Lopez: Morning, Anne & Tito.  Just to let you know I’m at the apartment with Alfonso. In case you want/ need to discuss anything.
[7/15/24, 8:55:29 AM] Anne Segars: I bought the tankless water heater and bathroom fans. They should be here Friday
[7/15/24, 8:56:18 AM] Anne Segars: Luis I’m working in the law firm this week but I think are questions are just confirming lighting in main area and bathroom sink/vanity.
[7/15/24, 10:48:06 AM] Anne Segars: Hi All - I can have all 3 toilets deliver Wednesday but need someone to receive it as they only deliver to either curb of condominium.  Does Wednesday work or another day? Thank you.

[7/16/24, 12:35:38 PM] Eddie Valdés: Hola

Roberto/Luis/Anne, which internet provider are you going to use at the Apt?

Where do you want the main router and how are you going to transmit the signal to other locations?

Let me know when you can.

Thanks
[7/16/24, 12:36:42 PM] Anne Segars: This is definitely a Roberto question. I know he wants fiber and ideally would have hard access in his office.
[7/16/24, 2:03:09 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Not sure who the provider will yet. Ideally we have an outlet under the TV (living room) and one in the office. I can be more specific if necessary. By when do we need to know provider?
[7/16/24, 2:03:43 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Also, are you upstairs now? I need to get my key back so I can make a copy and I have an extra key to the bldg to give you, as you requested.
[7/16/24, 2:07:24 PM] Eddie Valdés: I believe Alfonso is there now
[7/17/24, 10:52:15 AM] Anne Segars: Hi All - bought the tub today from Louis Friere. American Standard Studio 60x30 white tub alcove right hand drain. Should deliver around August 20.
[7/19/24, 10:38:13 AM] Eddie Valdés: Good morning

Roberto

Please find out about the Internet/TV provider as soon as possible.

If they’re going to hardwire the two locations you mentioned it needs to be done before we start installing walls.

Materials are arriving on site this morning.

We left your key over the kitchen counter.

Thanks
[7/19/24, 10:40:53 AM] Anne Segars: Ok I will come get the key in a bit and make copies.
[7/19/24, 10:45:42 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Got the key.
[7/19/24, 10:46:10 AM] Eddie Valdés: We can make copies.

What we really need is another Master key if possible.

Thanks
[7/19/24, 10:46:29 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: I have the new master key
[7/19/24, 10:46:50 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Let me know when you or Alfonso are here and I can come up and give it to you
[7/19/24, 7:07:22 PM] Anne Segars: We will be using Optico Fiber.
[7/22/24, 8:29:36 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Good morning. @17873667171 hoy tengo que cuadrar con ibertile la entrega de losas del baño del máster (todas las demás van a ser entregadas mañana por tile shop). Que día les
Conviene si no es mañana?
[7/22/24, 8:42:59 AM] Eddie Valdés: Good morning

Would it be possible to set up a meeting with Óptico Fiber at the  apartment to identify where the line comes in and where do we need to put the junction boxes and conduits?

Thanks
[7/22/24, 8:47:24 AM] Eddie Valdés: Buenos días Roberto

Nosotros nos encargamos de coordinar la entrega con Ibertile y Tile Shop

Estamos llamando ahora para cuadrarlo.

Así se les hace más fácil a ustedes.
[7/22/24, 8:50:03 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: La de Tile Shop La había cuadrado para mañana. Nos dijeron que como es edificio tenía que ser un contratista privado que cuesta 650. Pero sí, llámalos y cuadren directamente. Me avisas si puedo ayudar. Gracias
[7/22/24, 8:55:38 AM] Eddie Valdés: Vale. Les mantenemos al tanto.
[7/22/24, 8:56:09 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: ¡Gracias!
[7/22/24, 9:18:18 AM] Anne Segars: Yes. I’ll set up Optico
[7/22/24, 9:19:30 AM] Anne Segars: I also put 18N and extra gate clicker on kitchen counter
[7/22/24, 9:21:56 AM] Anne Segars: Key
[7/22/24, 9:27:06 AM] Eddie Valdés: I’m at the apartment
[7/22/24, 11:01:13 AM] Eddie Valdés: Roberto

Están entregando los inodoros

Los estamos subiendo.  Si tienes oportunidad de pasar y de paso me das la llave máster sería ideal.

Gracias
[7/22/24, 11:02:18 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Puedo subir a las 1130am
[7/22/24, 11:04:43 AM] Eddie Valdés: Ok
[7/23/24, 9:28:20 AM] Eddie Valdés: Roberto

El de transporte de llama José Luis Díaz.  $550
[7/23/24, 9:28:53 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Subo el cheque ahora. Le puedes preguntar a Luis si quiere que suba los extractores?
[7/23/24, 12:26:15 PM] Eddie Valdés: Do you have a way to contact Administration or Maintenance to have a dedicated elevator to get the tiles up to the Apt?
[7/23/24, 12:29:34 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Let me call Axel
[7/23/24, 12:29:40 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: What time?
[7/23/24, 12:36:50 PM] Eddie Valdés: They’re here in the basement
[7/23/24, 12:38:42 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Ok. I’m meeting the person in the lobby to get it done. I’ll see you in basement soon
[7/24/24, 9:49:34 AM] Eddie Valdés: Good morning

Roberto. Thanks for your help yesterday with the tiles delivery.

Anne:  any luck with Óptico Fiber?

Just to clarify:

1.  We have 3 TV junction boxes.  Are the TV’s going to be connected to Cable (Liberty or other). If so, we need to identify provider and entry into the Apt.

2. The Data junction boxes.  Do you use Ethernet?  If so, where is the main modem located?  I understand we have an outlet at the family and another at the office.  We need to identify where are they going to be connected.

Thanks you.
[7/24/24, 9:57:01 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: 1. No cable tv for televisions
2. ⁠Main modem will be located in the family room
[7/24/24, 11:17:19 AM] Eddie Valdés: Do you want to run a data cable from the family to the office?
[7/24/24, 11:18:23 AM] Anne Segars: Yes if possible
[7/24/24, 11:22:10 AM] Eddie Valdés: Family you mean next to the balcony?

We need to know where Óptico will enter the Apt
[7/24/24, 11:42:32 AM] Anne Segars: On the phone with Optico and they keep telling me to wait for a call to set up next week. But I believe it comes in through the phone lines which I think are in that middle area between 18N and 18S
[7/25/24, 4:19:15 PM] Anne Segars: Hi All - here is a live link of items with brands, location, model numbers, websites, delivery dates, etc… if you see something missing let me know. Probably means I haven’t ordered it yet but ask as maybe I forgot about it. This is a live link so this one link will show changes immediately
[7/25/24, 4:19:19 PM] Anne Segars: https://airtable.com/appxaC7A2SqRxz8WI/shrPDNf6oGC2k5wsw
[7/25/24, 4:24:22 PM] Eddie Valdés: Hi

We’ll take a look at it. Thanks
[7/26/24, 8:47:01 AM] Eddie Valdés: Good morning

Looking at the Airtable

Questions:

1. Are you buying all outlets and switches?  Switch plus wall plate?

2.  Where does the Dimmer switch will be located?  Is it a standard switch dimension?  2 x 4?

3.  Wallpaper was not considered. Are you installing separately?

4.  Kitchen equipment was not included.  Do you have someone to install them?

I believe everything we need is in there, but I’ll double check

Thanks for the Airtable. Great tool.  I use it myself.
[7/26/24, 8:59:23 AM] Anne Segars: 1. Yes I was going to buy all the switches and outlets. 

2. Dimmers are for all the light switches. I’ll check the standard but I would believe so. 

3. It’s just on the 1 small wall of Dante’s bedroom but if you all can’t put up, I can get someone. 

4. I can have someone else install.
[7/26/24, 9:19:02 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: @17873667171 for 4: we can have Best Buy install the electrical appliances. But your crew will remove the old ones, correct? 

Also - can you confirm that your crew will install the new sink in the kitchen?

Gracias.
[7/26/24, 9:26:56 AM] Eddie Valdés: None of the kitchen work was included in this proposal.

Let me talk to Alfonso and get back to you.
[7/26/24, 9:34:29 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Oh I thought installation of appliances was. I can double check later today - maybe I misread.
[7/26/24, 9:38:17 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: You’re right my bad - it’s not there. Can you all estimate how much it would be to install the sink? Gracias!
[7/26/24, 9:40:56 AM] Eddie Valdés: Yes

All kitchen work was eliminated due to cost on the last revised proposal.

We will have to make sure none of the cabinets or counter top will be affected.

Also, removal of appliances was not included, since it was related to kitchen work.
[7/26/24, 9:45:40 AM] Anne Segars: But to confirm you will install washer and dryer correct?
[7/26/24, 9:47:59 AM] Anne Segars: Also I looked on Legrand website and don’t see a reference to 2x4. Is that size dimension? With or without wall plate?
[7/26/24, 9:49:24 AM] Eddie Valdés: Yes. Washer and dryer are included to be installed

[7/26/24, 9:55:04 AM] Eddie Valdés: For each of the three bathrooms, you need to buy a plate for 3 switches.
[7/26/24, 10:37:19 AM] Anne Segars: Can we talk to the A/C guy? We want to have conversation with him to recommend the best/ most reliable a/c unit brands etc…
[7/26/24, 10:38:00 AM] Eddie Valdés: We can coordinate a meeting for next week
[7/26/24, 10:38:13 AM] Anne Segars: Sounds good! Thanks!

[7/29/24, 11:22:46 AM] Anne Segars: No they keep saying they will call me to set up an appointment and I call them and they say next week.

‎[7/31/24, 9:32:05 AM] Anne Segars: ‎<attached: 00000163-PHOTO-2024-07-31-09-32-06.jpg>

[7/31/24, 4:03:17 PM] Eddie Valdés: Hello

[8/1/24, 9:10:57 AM] Eddie Valdés: Thank you

[8/6/24, 11:36:53 AM] Alfonso: 👍
[8/7/24, 9:42:30 AM] Anne Segars: I have tile in square drain for guest shower and linear tile in shower for Master Bath. Do you want it in 18N or hold on to it for now
[8/7/24, 10:04:41 AM] Eddie Valdés: Good morning

We can have it at the apartment.
[8/9/24, 3:53:05 PM] Anne Segars: I put the electric tankless water heater up in the kitchen in 18N
[8/9/24, 3:53:39 PM] Anne Segars: I have the light fixture for Kids bathroom and it’s the same (except color) for Guest bath.
[8/9/24, 4:05:51 PM] Eddie Valdés: Thank you

They’re working on the guest bathroom now.  It would be good to have it at the apartment.
[8/9/24, 4:16:52 PM] Anne Segars: I just have the kid’s light but if you want it for measurement it’s the exact same.  Let me see if Roberto can run it up to 18
[8/9/24, 5:01:52 PM] Anne Segars: Roberto is bringing it up now

[8/10/24, 2:34:16 PM] Eddie Valdés: Hello Anne

We’re missing 3 tiles to finish the Master Bath.

We need to find out who can deliver them.
[8/10/24, 2:34:48 PM] Anne Segars: Bath tile came from Ibertile.
[8/10/24, 2:35:10 PM] Eddie Valdés: Also

Can you tell us the sizes and location of the Air conditioners you have at your current apartment?

Thank you.
[8/10/24, 2:35:24 PM] Anne Segars: Are we missing in the sense of they didn’t deliver or I need to order more?
[8/10/24, 2:35:38 PM] Eddie Valdés: We need additional
[8/10/24, 2:38:53 PM] Anne Segars: A/c are 12000 in master, office, kids room. 22000 in living room and playroom.   I wouldn’t mind if the master bedroom was bigger. 

Location of a/c:

Master on wall of walk in closet. 

Office on wall of walk in closet 

Kids room south wall (short wall opposite closet). 

Living room above tv 
 (same wall other side as Kids room)

Playroom on short wall so it blows straight into dining and kitchen
[8/10/24, 2:42:40 PM] Anne Segars: Marked with white X for a/c units
‎[8/10/24, 2:43:10 PM] Anne Segars: ‎<attached: 00000199-PHOTO-2024-08-10-14-43-11.jpg>
[8/10/24, 2:45:41 PM] Anne Segars: Let me know if I need to do something with Ibertile
[8/10/24, 2:49:28 PM] Eddie Valdés: Yes please. Order the 3 extra tiles and see if that can deliver them.

As for the A/C’s. Where are they located at your apartment on the 10th floor?

I understand you have two 22,000 units?
‎[8/10/24, 2:55:10 PM] Anne Segars: ‎<attached: 00000202-PHOTO-2024-08-10-14-55-11.jpg>
[8/10/24, 2:55:47 PM] Anne Segars: Playroom unit in 10N is a crappy barely working window unit. Don’t know BTUs
[8/10/24, 2:58:52 PM] Anne Segars: So right now the playroom and kitchen get hot when cooking or in summer
[8/10/24, 3:14:34 PM] Anne Segars: We ordered tiles. We got 2 boxes (4 tiles). Just waiting on when we can get delivery or pick up
[8/10/24, 3:33:11 PM] Anne Segars: FYI- Ibertile said a big project is about to use the Luca tiles too. Do you think we will need extra of the Lucca All in One for floor?
[8/10/24, 4:01:13 PM] Eddie Valdés: Is the Lucca the one in the Master Bath?
[8/10/24, 4:01:24 PM] Eddie Valdés: Copy. Thanks
[8/10/24, 4:20:43 PM] Anne Segars: Yes. Lucca is in master bath. Soft is walls which we just bought more of. Lucca all in one is the floor for the master bath.
[8/10/24, 4:21:59 PM] Eddie Valdés: Alfonso is going to call Ibertile. What we need is walls. He’s calling now
[8/10/24, 4:27:50 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: I bought 2 cases of 2 tiles each of the Luca Soft for the master bath according to this: Hello Anne

We’re missing 3 tiles to finish the Master Bath.

We need to find out who can deliver them.
[8/10/24, 4:28:08 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Paid for them already. Do I need to call them as well?
[8/10/24, 4:28:47 PM] Eddie Valdés: Perfect. That’s what we need. 3 tiles for the walls (Soft)
[8/10/24, 4:29:03 PM] Eddie Valdés: No need. Thanks
[8/10/24, 4:29:34 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Master Bathroom Walls correct. Ok we’re good then !
[8/10/24, 4:31:00 PM] Eddie Valdés: Yes for the walls.

Regarding the floor tiles, we won’t know until they’re cut and start placing them.
[8/12/24, 1:11:41 PM] Anne Segars: Optico cancelled meeting tomorrow due to weather. I’ll let you know when rescheduled
[8/12/24, 1:15:14 PM] Eddie Valdés: Thanks
[8/12/24, 1:17:33 PM] Anne Segars: Monday August 26 in the morning is now the Optico time
[8/12/24, 1:19:44 PM] Eddie Valdés: Copy
[8/13/24, 1:45:14 PM] Eddie Valdés: Roberto

This is the order for the additional tiles.  

Delivery is $275 to be paid separately on Friday with a check made out to Pablo Santiago.

If possible, call Beba to pay for this order.  We will discount $232.32 from your next Invoice.  This is the amount corresponding to Leo.

Thanks

[8/15/24, 7:47:14 AM] Anne Segars: Leaving check for Pablo Santiago on kitchen counter there 18N
[8/15/24, 7:49:45 AM] Eddie Valdés: Thank you.  Did you processed payment with Ibertile?
[8/15/24, 7:50:06 AM] Anne Segars: I’ll check with Roberto
[8/15/24, 7:55:54 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Could t reach them yesterday. I’ll call them at 9am today
[8/15/24, 7:55:59 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Unless they open earlier
[8/15/24, 7:57:14 AM] Eddie Valdés: Ok. Let me know. Thanks
[8/15/24, 9:02:55 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Just paid Ibertile.
[8/18/24, 10:45:39 AM] Eddie Valdés: Good morning Anne and Roberto

Sorry to bother you on a Sunday.

Thinking about moving the delivery of the appliances at least two weeks since they will be in the way to install the tiles.

Is it possible?

Thanks
[8/18/24, 10:48:26 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Morning Eddie. Right now they’re coming August 26th. When would you be ready for them?
[8/18/24, 10:49:41 AM] Eddie Valdés: Let me talk to Leo tomorrow and give you an update.

Gracias
[8/18/24, 10:53:29 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Sounds good. Once we have a date we can ask Best Buy. Happy Sunday!
[8/18/24, 10:54:53 AM] Eddie Valdés: Thanks. Same!!
[8/19/24, 8:40:24 AM] Eddie Valdés: Good morning

We shall be receiving the bathtub today, correct?

Do you have delivery or tracking information for this delivery?

Also.  Do you have the drain for the bathtub, or is it included?

Thanks
[8/19/24, 8:47:58 AM] Anne Segars: Not sure. Confirming with them once store opens
[8/19/24, 8:48:32 AM] Eddie Valdés: Perfect

Thanks
[8/19/24, 9:36:28 AM] Anne Segars: Not today. Luis Freire is trying to find the date.
[8/19/24, 9:36:43 AM] Anne Segars: Have a feeling it will be delayed but should know in a few hours
[8/19/24, 9:40:00 AM] Eddie Valdés: Ok. Thanks 

Could you find out if you bought the drain as well along with the tub, or separate?  And delivery date for that.

Thanks
[8/19/24, 9:51:30 AM] Anne Segars: I will confirm but I believe I bought drain with it
[8/19/24, 9:52:34 AM] Eddie Valdés: Ok

Also. Did you have a chance to look at the Estimate for the AC work?
[8/19/24, 10:05:25 AM] Anne Segars: I did buy a drain but both are now delayed another 4 weeks
[8/19/24, 10:06:36 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: We saw the AC estimate. We’re reaching out to another vendor to get another one.
[8/19/24, 10:13:41 AM] Eddie Valdés: Ok.  Just as a side note.  Verify with the other vendor if the equipment is here in Puerto Rico.  There is a shortage.  We are pressed for time to finish some areas of the work, like for example the gypsum and closing up the walls.  They need to be installed by next week.  Thank you
[8/19/24, 10:15:14 AM] Eddie Valdés: Same as the last message sent, we are pressed for time.  Dante’s bathroom can‘t be worked on until we get the bathtub and drain.  Any chance to search for another supplier?  If it is a regular American Standard 60” bathtub is available at Home Depot, same as the drain.

Keep me posted.  Thanks
[8/19/24, 10:25:51 AM] Anne Segars: No it’s a more modern line bathtub.
[8/19/24, 10:26:05 AM] Eddie Valdés: Copy
[8/19/24, 10:30:30 AM] Anne Segars: I did look at the estimate. Both were higher than I had estimated. Do we save money if we move the master bedroom and study A/Cs to the blue dots?
‎[8/19/24, 10:30:38 AM] Anne Segars: ‎<attached: 00000250-PHOTO-2024-08-19-10-30-39.jpg>
[8/19/24, 10:32:35 AM] Anne Segars: If we do 12000 for all bedrooms and 18000 for above tv and 24000 for playroom does that bring cost down at all?
[8/19/24, 10:36:33 AM] Eddie Valdés: Moving the units to the blue dots won’t make a substantial difference.

Installing less powered units will translate into some savings.  We quoted the more expensive units because of time constraints and availability in the market.  Midea is less expensive, but not available.  We can do the exercise and see how much you can save lowering the capacity.
[8/19/24, 10:41:09 AM] Anne Segars: Thank you.
[8/19/24, 10:50:41 AM] Eddie Valdés: What are the red dots?
[8/19/24, 10:57:32 AM] Anne Segars: Sorry at the office. Only image I had. It’s the one I sent you last week to show you where they are on apartment 10N
[8/19/24, 10:57:53 AM] Eddie Valdés: Ok.  No worries.
[8/19/24, 11:16:24 AM] Anne Segars: I now have all appliances (washer, dryer, dishwasher and fridge) coming September 9/9with dishwasher installation on 9/10
[8/19/24, 11:16:31 AM] Anne Segars: Let me know if that works.
[8/21/24, 7:53:08 AM] Eddie Valdés: Good morning Anne.

Sounds good.
[8/21/24, 7:55:23 AM] Eddie Valdés: I’ll check with our AC guy if those combinations will work.
[8/21/24, 8:22:50 AM] Eddie Valdés: Anne.

His recommendation is to keep the capacity of the equipment as quoted.  We can downgrade to Midea or similar if available, but it all depends on the project schedule.

Feel free to get another quote, as I understand you’re working on, so that you can compare price and recommendations.
[8/23/24, 12:53:45 PM] Anne Segars: Hi Eddie,

We are going to go with my in-laws company Sky Air for the A/Cs. Is it best for us to connect you? I believe he has all the units and could begin this coming week (I think).
[8/23/24, 12:55:28 PM] Eddie Valdés: Hi Anne

Let me find out what would be the best option and I’ll get back to you.
[8/23/24, 2:08:11 PM] Eddie Valdés: Anne

I assume they will do the installation, correct?
[8/23/24, 2:08:51 PM] Anne Segars: Yes. They will.
[8/23/24, 2:31:36 PM] Eddie Valdés: In that case, it will run as a separate contract between you and them.

We won’t be able to supervise their work.

We can have an initial meeting with them for any questions they might have.

Once they start finishing up we will coordinate with Leo to start closing the gypsum walls where the electrical and refrigerant lines run.

Let me know the you want to have the initial meeting.

Thank you.
[8/23/24, 6:04:34 PM] Anne Segars: Hi Eddie I’m hoping Monday or Tuesday and have work start as soon as you all want it
[8/25/24, 1:24:10 PM] Anne Segars: Hi Eddie - sent invoice payment. I’m back from NYC. Gabriel Velez should reach out to you to find best time for him to come in with A/Cs and install etc..

Let me know what’s outstanding that you need from us.
[8/25/24, 1:28:57 PM] Eddie Valdés: Hi Anne

Thank you.

Perfect. Will check our outstanding tasks and let you know.
[8/25/24, 1:30:38 PM] Anne Segars: Also Optico Fiber should come sometime between 8-11 tomorrow.
[8/25/24, 1:31:59 PM] Eddie Valdés: Ok
[8/26/24, 7:56:37 AM] Eddie Valdés: Good morning

[8/26/24, 8:35:10 AM] Eddie Valdés: Here
[8/26/24, 1:26:36 PM] Anne Segars: Gabriel said the A/Cs will start Sept 3rd. Does that work for you all?
[8/26/24, 1:32:35 PM] Alfonso: I just talk with him….
[8/26/24, 1:49:18 PM] Eddie Valdés: Which option did you finally decided upon?
[8/26/24, 6:12:54 PM] Anne Segars: We did Trane a/cs
[8/26/24, 6:18:54 PM] Anne Segars: Guest bathroom above sink light is in. I will put in 18N kitchen counter.
[8/26/24, 6:19:31 PM] Eddie Valdés: Ok. Thanks
[8/27/24, 8:25:34 AM] Eddie Valdés: Good morning everyone

[9/2/24, 6:16:37 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Also if you’re using the parking spot from tomorrow on you just use 18N. Today we moved out of 10N so we lose that parking spot. 18N is across the way from 10-N, the second spot from left to right if you’re looking at the elevators. You’ll see plastic boxes and some carts there
[9/3/24, 5:38:08 PM] Anne Segars: Hi All - the A/C guys installed living room, playroom/dining room and master and ran some wires. Tomorrow they will put in office and child’s room.

[9/9/24, 9:28:20 AM] Eddie Valdés: Hi Anne and Roberto

Where can we pick up the keys today?
[9/9/24, 9:28:47 AM] Anne Segars: 655 Calle Estado. Tito can hand them to you
[9/9/24, 9:28:59 AM] Eddie Valdés: Ok. Perfect
[9/9/24, 9:29:05 AM] Anne Segars: House with the green gate
[9/9/24, 9:29:41 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Yup got them here. @17873667171 send me a msg when you’re here and I’ll come out with the keys
[9/9/24, 9:30:06 AM] Eddie Valdés: Thank you
[9/9/24, 10:09:18 AM] Alfonso: Well I’m at 655 estado
[9/9/24, 10:09:44 AM] Anne Segars: Ok coming around with keys
[9/9/24, 10:09:47 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Salgo ahora
[9/9/24, 10:09:54 AM] Alfonso: Vale
[9/10/24, 1:07:05 PM] Anne Segars: Hi all - do I get a 15a (amperage) or 20a (amperage) switches?

[9/10/24, 1:27:28 PM] Anne Segars: The a/c guy Issac is down on the street. I don’t have keys. Can someone let him into 18N?
[9/10/24, 1:28:53 PM] Eddie Valdés: Let me call Leo
[9/10/24, 1:29:17 PM] Anne Segars: Thanks
[9/10/24, 2:27:36 PM] Eddie Valdés: Not sure
[9/10/24, 3:25:19 PM] Luis Lopez: My electrical engineer specifies 20amps for switches, but it all depends on what breakers these circuits are attached to.  Alfonso, can your electrical guy confirm which is correct?
[9/12/24, 10:08:28 AM] Anne Segars: Tub has arrived .  I have paid for delivery (but maybe just to front of building?). Can you all call to set up delivery day, time and details? It’s Maggie at Luis Freire 787-622-0505.
[9/12/24, 10:09:42 AM] Anne Segars: Also I know they sent the wrong color for the drain top. They sent chrome when I ordered white. Can we install the chrome and layer just replace the white? Otherwise it takes a week for the new one to arrive.
[9/12/24, 10:31:56 AM] Anne Segars: Ok so tub can be delivered whenever but drain will be here on 22nd. Do you want tub delivered before the drain gets here or both tub and drain on 22nd?
[9/13/24, 11:20:41 AM] Eddie Valdés: Hi Anne

We haven’t forgotten about you.  😁. Let me double check the info on the bathtub.
[9/16/24, 10:02:16 AM] Eddie Valdés: Good morning Anne

Alfonso is getting in touch with Maggie for delivery.

Let’s get it in with the drain as it is and we’ll figure out what’s the best option.
[9/17/24, 10:59:16 AM] Eddie Valdés: Good morning Anne

Are the light switches at the apartment?
[9/17/24, 11:13:17 AM] Eddie Valdés: Hi

We received a quote to finish all the walls with plaster for $5,100

Let us know if you approve so that we can coordinate to start.

Thank you.
[9/17/24, 11:23:14 AM] Anne Segars: Haven’t bought yet but can today. Just need to know so 15A or 20A
[9/17/24, 11:23:53 AM] Alfonso: 20 a is ok
[9/18/24, 8:55:50 AM] Anne Segars: Light switches (but no plates are in house and in bags for each room) 

Outlets are in house with plates though I have a few questions on if I need to get cable or different type outlet things in living area.
‎[9/18/24, 8:56:07 AM] Anne Segars: ‎image omitted
[9/18/24, 8:56:43 AM] Anne Segars: Also I have 2 type of outlets so I’ve taped the “special” ones in their exact location.

[9/18/24, 9:02:13 AM] Anne Segars: Also price on plaster is fine but question do we lose space? Do you have to do the built out things on every wall or is it directly to the wall that exists?
‎[9/18/24, 9:02:19 AM] Anne Segars: ‎<attached: 00000368-PHOTO-2024-09-18-09-02-20.jpg>
[9/18/24, 9:07:41 AM] Eddie Valdés: Hi Anne

Is directly on the wall.  No need to build into the space.
[9/18/24, 9:07:57 AM] Anne Segars: Great. Confirmed.
[9/18/24, 9:29:44 AM] Anne Segars: Also in walk in closet is it one outlet and one switch?

And how many in pantry?

[9/18/24, 11:05:09 AM] Eddie Valdés: I believe is two junction boxes (blank cover)
[9/18/24, 11:05:32 AM] Anne Segars: Thanks!
[9/18/24, 11:06:02 AM] Eddie Valdés: Two outlets - Right is for Refrigerator and left is emergency outlet to connect the Power Generator
[9/18/24, 11:46:05 AM] Luis Lopez: Junction box above and outlet below.
[9/23/24, 2:19:29 PM] Anne Segars: Appliances deliver tomorrow

[9/24/24, 8:51:06 AM] Anne Segars: Yes I believe so
[9/24/24, 8:58:27 AM] Anne Segars: Is all of it ready to be plugged in etc?

[9/24/24, 1:32:53 PM] Anne Segars: Washer and dryer in. Dishwasher delivered but not installed. Refrigerator wouldn’t fit in elevator so we are trying to figure that out
[9/24/24, 1:37:44 PM] Eddie Valdés: They probably need to take the doors out. It will not fit through the kitchen entrance either.
[9/24/24, 1:38:06 PM] Eddie Valdés: We had to take the doors out of the old refrigerator to get it out of the kitchen
‎[9/27/24, 1:13:13 PM] Eddie Valdés: ‎<attached: 00000391-PHOTO-2024-09-27-13-13-14.jpg>
[10/2/24, 1:05:10 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: @17873667171 @17879600536 we measured the elevator door in the basement and that ones only about an inch less than the fridge (with doors on). Seems that we could get it through there. I can schedule Best Buy to deliver and have them wheel it down to basement. But we’ll need people from your team to take fridge out of box, take off doors and then get it up to the 18 floor and the apt. Can we set that up? If so, let me know when so I can schedule delivery. Thank you!
[10/2/24, 1:55:38 PM] Eddie Valdés: @16462426023 and @12022707306

We would love to help you with this, but we don’t have the manpower with knowledge to take out the doors, etc or the equipment to move the refrigerator around safely.

There’s too much liability involved if something happens to the refrigerator, considering that you won’t be able to return it if something happens.

Has Best Buy given you a reason as to why they won’t do it?  They would have to remove the doors anyway.  It won’t go through the kitchen opening.

The only thing we can recommend is that you contact a Moving Company with experience in that type of equipment.

This guy has worked with Alfonso before moving furniture and equipment.  Please contact him to see if he can do the job.(939) 339-3168 (Moises Moving)
[10/2/24, 3:42:34 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Hi Eddie. Best Buy keeps insisting their guys can’t even take the item out of the box before it’s in its final location. So that means even if the got the box up the elevator and inside the apartment they would not get it into the kitchen. Sounds ridiculous to me but we’re at an impasse. I’ll call Moises see if he and his team can get this done.
[10/2/24, 3:46:54 PM] Alfonso: His a good guy
[10/2/24, 6:10:55 PM] Anne Segars: Did we hear anything on the bathroom drain? Did it come in today?
[10/2/24, 6:12:07 PM] Alfonso: Nop
[10/2/24, 6:12:13 PM] Alfonso: 🥺
[10/3/24, 3:36:45 PM] Anne Segars: More covers for the outlets and switches delivered and are on the kitchen counter. I also noticed a few of the switches and outlets are wrong.
[10/3/24, 4:09:57 PM] Eddie Valdés: Copy

Pls let us know which ones need to be changed

Thanks
[10/3/24, 4:21:59 PM] Anne Segars: No problem. May be easier to do in person.  😄 also I have the 3 gang cover for the primary bathroom. Thanks!
[10/4/24, 8:37:22 AM] Eddie Valdés: Good morning Anne

We can meet at the apt to go over the switches if you’re available.
[10/4/24, 8:52:11 AM] Anne Segars: I’m available around 11am if that works
[10/4/24, 9:44:26 AM] Eddie Valdés: Perfect

[10/10/24, 12:16:55 PM] Anne Segars: They can’t send via DHL or UPS?

Sorry for the time.

We need an extra box of Dante’s bathroom wall tile.

We can pick it up.

Thanks
[10/21/24, 9:06:11 PM] Anne Segars: Ok thank you. It’s from The Tile shop. Under Roberto Buso Garcia 646-242-6023.
[10/21/24, 9:18:50 PM] Eddie Valdés: Perfect. Thanks

Also, we had to buy tile adhesive.  There wasn’t enough to finish Dante’s bathroom.

Have a good night.
[10/22/24, 6:20:33 PM] Anne Segars: Hi All - can someone be at the apartment for 8am-1pm tomorrow? Best Buy is supposed to install fridge and dishwasher
[10/22/24, 6:22:21 PM] Eddie Valdés: Hi Anne

Sorry, but we’re tied up with two other projects all day.
[10/23/24, 2:41:42 PM] Eddie Valdés: Hi Anne

Alfonso is at the tile shop and there’s no order on file for the extra box of tiles for Dante’s bathroom.

All the orders under Roberto’s name appear as delivered.
[10/23/24, 2:43:00 PM] Anne Segars: Oh I thought you all would order. I just got out of the hospital
[10/23/24, 2:44:52 PM] Alfonso: No problem … I will buy it
[10/23/24, 2:45:18 PM] Alfonso: I need to know the name of the tile
[10/23/24, 2:45:19 PM] Eddie Valdés: Are you ok?
[10/23/24, 2:45:31 PM] Anne Segars: Thanks our credit card should be on file.
[10/23/24, 2:46:14 PM] Anne Segars: Slowly. Had microhemorrhage on the brain

Can’t seem to find the range/oven microwave on the specs you sent.

Also.  We’re quoting the Kitchen and walk-in closet as requested.

Please advise laminate details.

Thanks
[10/28/24, 11:40:05 AM] Anne Segars: I will send those specs shortly. Will someone be there tomorrow to just let in the dishwasher guy?

[11/4/24, 10:03:41 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: On Saturday I swung by the apartment and found copious pools of water by the balcony windows and inside the office. 

The water in the office seems to have come from the floor. 

What do we need to do to fix this?
[11/4/24, 10:08:34 AM] Eddie Valdés: Hola Roberto

That water is probably from the windows, not the floor.

We will take a look, but the water is leaking from the windows.  We can have someone inspecting them and looking into it.
[11/4/24, 10:11:25 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Thank you Eddie. Yes wherever the water comes from we need to fix it. Thanks again

Also. We had the electrician today for a quote.

Thanks
[11/20/24, 4:23:07 PM] Eddie Valdés: Anne

This is the one recommended. You can buy it at the Home Depot.

[11/21/24, 1:13:40 PM] Eddie Valdés: Hi Anne and Roberto

During our meeting with Luis on Tuesday, we asked him about the ceiling?

Just wanted to know if you have a decision regarding the ceiling finish.

We tried a primer that he recommended and painted a portion of the master bedroom ceiling where there is both plaster and cement to see if the primer covered the difference in finish.  It doesn’t cover it completely and you can see both rough and smooth finishes.

Please let us know what you would like to do.

The other option is to plaster all the ceiling.  We can get a quote for you.

Thank you
[11/21/24, 2:31:18 PM] Eddie Valdés: Hi

Could you please talk to your neighbor across the hall?  Leo tried to open the door to the pantry between the apartments and apparently is closed from the inside.

We need to make the connection for the emergency outlet.

Thank you.
[11/21/24, 2:34:01 PM] Anne Segars: It is unlocked but is very hard to open. You should be able to open but you have to really throw your body at it.
[11/22/24, 1:34:39 PM] Eddie Valdés: Good afternoon

Tuesday afternoon they will remove the storm shutters.  We will be there.
[11/22/24, 2:02:40 PM] Anne Segars: We will go tomorrow morning to look at ceiling

Si hay alguna otra ventana(s) que urge me dejan saber para que las haga ese día también.

[12/6/24, 1:19:49 PM] Anne Segars: And if we go with option number 2, is that ok with building or do we need to get additional approval

[12/18/24, 12:31:39 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: @17873667171 we have the serviceman installing the fridge in the apt and he says that the water main for the refrigerator does not work. Have we had plumbers in the work at all? Just wondering how we can address this since we need that fridge up and running. :) thank you!
[12/18/24, 12:34:07 PM] Eddie Valdés: @16462426023 Leo worked the necessary plumbing for the bathrooms, but we did not do any work at the kitchen.  The water source for the ice maker is the original one at the apartment.  It wasn’t replaced. ‎<This message was edited>
[12/18/24, 12:34:43 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Ok. So it seems that it’s broken. :(
[12/18/24, 12:34:58 PM] Anne Segars: How do we replace it?
[12/18/24, 12:35:17 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Can we have the fridge guy install the fridge and then either replace or fix that water source after?
[12/18/24, 12:35:31 PM] Eddie Valdés: It’s just a matter of replacing the coupling.
[12/18/24, 12:35:34 PM] Eddie Valdés: Sure
[12/18/24, 12:37:45 PM] Anne Segars: Ok so they are going to I stall no water line and is there anyway Thursday or Friday we can replace the coupling and have it hooked to fridge?
[12/18/24, 12:37:54 PM] Eddie Valdés: It all depends if the fridge can be moved out after they install it.  Do you want us to do it?
[12/18/24, 12:38:25 PM] Anne Segars: Probably since I don’t know if Best Buy will come out again
[12/18/24, 12:38:53 PM] Eddie Valdés: Is water coming out if they turn it? ‎<This message was edited>
[12/18/24, 12:40:25 PM] Eddie Valdés: Can you send us a picture of the coupling?  We can send Julito out to replace it.

[12/18/24, 1:03:02 PM] Eddie Valdés: OK. I’ll be there shortly and Julito will be there later to replace it

Will they leave all the water hoses connected to the fridge?
[12/18/24, 1:03:27 PM] Anne Segars: Not sure. They just left
[12/18/24, 1:04:32 PM] Eddie Valdés: Oh!  I think it would have been best for them to make all the connections so that we didn’t have to deal with the fridge
[12/18/24, 1:04:45 PM] Eddie Valdés: For warranty purposes and all
[12/18/24, 1:05:01 PM] Anne Segars: I don’t know what any of this means
[12/18/24, 1:05:25 PM] Anne Segars: Maybe they are there maybe not
[12/18/24, 1:05:35 PM] Eddie Valdés: Ok. I’ll be there shortly. We can talk then
[12/18/24, 1:05:36 PM] Anne Segars: Fridge is hooked for coldness
[12/18/24, 1:05:53 PM] Anne Segars: Ok I’m running to get a sandwich from Sabao. There should be parking
[12/18/24, 1:06:11 PM] Eddie Valdés: Ok
[12/18/24, 4:47:03 PM] Eddie Valdés: Hi

Leaving now.

Hallway light is working.  We removed one of the switches until we speak with Luminati tomorrow.  Apple can’t have two  dimmers working as a 3 way (we are not sure).

We replaced the one in the office with the one we took out of the hallway and it’s working fine.

Tomorrow we will know if we have to replace one of the living room dimmers.

More to come!  

Have a good evening.
[12/18/24, 6:02:30 PM] Eddie Valdés: So. As suspected. We can’t have two dimmers connected to the same 3-way setting.

We’re going to need two single switches without dimmers.  One for the hall and one for the living room.

Those are the two we have problems with.

I think I saw two single pole switches in a box at the kitchen counter.

We can work on that tomorrow.
[12/18/24, 8:04:51 PM] Anne Segars: Can we just use one dimmer for the living room? And hall doesn’t need to dim. We can discuss tomorrow
[12/18/24, 8:05:03 PM] Anne Segars: Anytime our water heater is used it sounds like this

[12/18/24, 8:05:31 PM] Anne Segars: Also drain in tub is broken. First time I turned know correctly it just stayed down
[12/18/24, 8:12:49 PM] Eddie Valdés: Ok. Will look into it tomorrow.
[12/19/24, 11:00:12 AM] Eddie Valdés: We’ll be there in a while. Were waiting for the doors.
[12/19/24, 12:34:26 PM] Eddie Valdés: Anne. Are you up at the apartment
[12/19/24, 12:42:14 PM] Anne Segars: For one second. About to take Dante out.
[12/19/24, 12:43:34 PM] Anne Segars: Leaving now if someone needs my car space
[12/19/24, 12:47:16 PM] Eddie Valdés: Thanks
[12/19/24, 4:31:59 PM] Anne Segars: Can all bathroom sinks be used?
[12/19/24, 4:32:20 PM] Eddie Valdés: Yes
[12/19/24, 4:32:28 PM] Alfonso: Yes
[12/19/24, 4:35:22 PM] Eddie Valdés: They brought two doors to square the frames.  They took them back to finish them up.

They also took the vanity drawers to fix them to fit the drains.

They probably be back tomorrow and/or Monday.

Work in progress.

We don’t want to be in your way these days.  Let us know of any plans we should be aware of. ‎<This message was edited>

[1/22/25, 1:38:47 PM] Eddie Valdés: Anne

Do you have by any chance a spec sheet of the drain you bought for Dante’s bathtub?
[1/22/25, 2:07:46 PM] Anne Segars: It was American Standard drain that came with tub. In white instead of chrome. I got it at Luis Fire.
[1/22/25, 2:57:07 PM] Eddie Valdés: Ok. We talked to Luis Freire and we found a Soec and Installation Sheet.

The other drain cover we bought arrived yesterday.
[1/22/25, 3:12:09 PM] Anne Segars: Great. FYI the glass people are installing the shower doors tomorrow from 9-9
[1/22/25, 3:12:14 PM] Anne Segars: 8-9am
[1/22/25, 3:23:03 PM] Eddie Valdés: Hola Roberto

Please let us know if you need clarification regarding our last invoice.

It was sent Jan 2 and later revised and sent on Jan 7 after my conversation with Luis where some completion percentages were adjusted.

Since we haven’t heard anything from you after your revision, we’re concerned there is a latent issue with what at our best knowledge is a fair representation of our finished work.

We will appreciate to hear from you promptly regarding this matter to avoid any unnecessary delays.

Thanks in advance
[1/23/25, 4:51:11 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Hola Eddie. Yes I see a few issues. I met with @17875683420 this morning and went through them. I’ll draft an email tonight and send it to everyone  on this channel. ‎<This message was edited>
[1/23/25, 4:51:17 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Thank you for your patience.
[1/23/25, 7:05:15 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Hi @17873667171 before I finish drafting the email, I do need a piece of information. In the original agreement a floor drain for Roberto Dante’s room was included. We removed that from the work but did not get the credit. How much is that credit? With that number, I can finish the calculations and send them your way. Thank. you
[1/23/25, 7:47:15 PM] Eddie Valdés: @⁨Roberto Buso-Garcia⁩ We have a contract with a set amount plus change orders.  The plans we received to quote the work were preliminary plans with  lacking information.  The full amount will be billed as per work performed. At the end.  We’ve done everything extra you asked for and have been more than complacent with your requests. 

We still have some change orders we haven’t charged for; the Carrara Marble in the guest bathroom and vanity, the magnet door paneling for Dante’s bedroom, re-installing lamps we already installed and some other items that we are not charging for.

Those will be billed separately on a Change Order invoice at a later time along with our last invoice, but for the exercise you’re performing, please go ahead and apply a $250 credit for the drain.
[1/23/25, 7:50:32 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: I am addressing the inconsistencies in the invoices and errors in your calculations as you have sent them. I will include the $250 credit as part of that. What has not been invoiced obviously is not part of this conversation. That will be addressed when invoiced. ‎<This message was edited>
[1/23/25, 7:51:57 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: I will send it in the morning
[1/23/25, 8:02:14 PM] Eddie Valdés: Ok. Thank you.  Until we receive payment for the Jan 7th invoice we won’t resume work at the project.
[1/23/25, 8:48:55 PM] Eddie Valdés: Invoice was adjusted based on your conversation with Luis on Jan 7th. Not clear as to what other adjustments were necessary.
[1/24/25, 4:41:03 PM] Eddie Valdés: Nos quedamos esperando.
[1/24/25, 4:56:18 PM] Luis Lopez: Hola Alfonso y Eddie. Podemos vernos el lunes en el proyecto y aclarar todas las dudas?  Yo puedo antes de las 4:00 pm.
[1/24/25, 6:59:23 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Somos 2 o 3?
[1/24/25, 7:00:20 PM] Alfonso: ????
[1/24/25, 7:03:32 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Sorry. Wrong chat!
[1/25/25, 11:49:21 AM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Good morning, hope you’re having a nice weekend. Here’s the document we’re aiming to discuss on Monday. I already sent it via email: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yQU2PbpetPCfsUCUQQj1ccrUEroD2hH3H0BRS3T7kMA/edit?usp=sharing
[1/26/25, 1:16:46 PM] Eddie Valdés: Good Afternoon

Here’s the document in response to the one we received yesterday.

Happy Sunday

[1/26/25, 1:21:30 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: Hey Eddie - yes I did get the sum and division wrong. But I still disagree with the percentages and I stand behind the other discrepancies. Let’s discuss tomorrow @17875683420 did you all agree on a time?
[1/26/25, 1:36:21 PM] Eddie Valdés: Hi Roberto

We stand by our analysis based on our Invoices and Payments received.  We can adjust the last invoice to the amount we arrived at, but I suggest you meet with @17875683420 tomorrow and go over them and cross check with the amounts I indicated in my reply.

I double-checked every invoice and change order. They’re all correct.  The work has been performed.  You received those invoices and change orders, approved them and paid them.

Please go over my calculations with Baquero and we’ll schedule another meeting afterwards.

Thank you.
[1/26/25, 1:39:11 PM] Roberto Buso-Garcia: For the record: I disagree that the invoices are correct and that 91% of the agreed upon work has been delivered successfully - this is why we are having these conversations. But sure, I’ll
meet with Luis tomorrow. Then you can meet with him at your convenience.
[1/26/25, 1:48:27 PM] Eddie Valdés: The invoices were paid for, that means you agreed to them.

The 91% responds to what Baquero asked me (during a phone conversation we sustained) to change the percentages to.

Está lloviendo sobre mojado, como dicen por ahí, since the remaining balance is the same.

This is a futile exercise.
